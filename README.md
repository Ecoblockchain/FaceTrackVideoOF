Right now this is just the empty example from ofxFaceTracker.

To compile/run this you need:
- ofxOpenCv (comes with oF)
- ofxCv (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv)
- ofxFaceTracker (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker)

If you want to use the Makefile, you'll also need the develop branch of openFrameworks:
https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/develop
